## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub page! Here you will find my projects from my computer science endeavors. See you around!

#### Coding Languages I'm currently learning:

🐍-Python
  -> The langauge I have a basic grasp on, better than the other two at least.

🍵-Javascript
  -> The second language I learned, not as good as the first but hey it's a start.

☕️-Java
  -> Just started learning this, but I'll be honest, it's pain
  
Am I good at any of the above? Not at all, I'm still learning.

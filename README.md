<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋</h1>

<h3 align="center">Welcome to my GitHub page! Here you will find my projects that I procastinate on constantly.</h3>
<br>

#### Coding Languages I'm currently learning:

🐍 Python
  -> The langauge I have a basic grasp on, better than the other two at least.

🍵 Javascript
  -> The second language I learned, not as good as the first but hey it's a start.

☕️ Java
  -> Just started learning this, but I'll be honest, it's pain.

<br>
Am I good at any of the languages above? Not at all, I'm still learning.
